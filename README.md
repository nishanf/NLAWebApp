Notes


To run the application do the following steps:

1. Get the code from Github repository by
	git clone https://github.com/nishanf/NLAWebApp

2. Change into the application directory
	cd NLAWebApp/

3. Run application
      mvn jetty:run

4. Open web browser to location http://localhost:8080/

5. Click through the functionality

6. To shut the Jetty server down from another terminal go to the project application folder NLAWebApp and type 
     mvn jetty:stop


I have also written some JUnit tests. They can be found in the folder NLAWebApp/src/test/java/gov/nla/service/
